AgriSense
AgriSense is an advanced AI-driven system designed for agriculture. It analyzes crop images and environmental data to predict potential disease outbreaks, provide actionable insights, and recommend treatments. This project aims to enhance crop management and improve agricultural practices through smart technology.

Features
Real-time Environmental Readings: Collects data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, NPK readings, light intensity, and wind speed from sensors.
Automatic Irrigation: Controls irrigation based on environmental conditions and soil moisture levels.
Animal Detection and Deterrence: Detects and deters animals that may harm crops.
Pest Detection and Control: Identifies pests and recommends control measures.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests suitable fertilizers based on soil and crop data.
Chatbot: Provides real-time assistance and answers related to crop management and disease prediction.
Fire and Gas Detection: Monitors and alerts for fire or gas leaks in the field.
Crop Recommendation: Suggests crops suitable for the given environmental conditions.

Frontend (React + Chart.js + Convex)
Purpose: Manages the user interface and user experience of the application.

Backend (Node.js + convex)
Purpose: Handles server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.

Microcontroller
Purpose: Contains code for microcontrollers to manage sensors and actuators. Also to share data from sensors to server.

Server (Flask + Convex)
Purpose: Transfers sensor data to the Convex database and manages data ingestion.
